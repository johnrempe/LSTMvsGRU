# LSTM vs GRU: Time Series Forecasting Comparison
### Overview

This project compares Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks for time series forecasting. The models are trained to predict stock closing prices using historical financial data and multiple input features.

The notebook walks through:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model building (LSTM and GRU)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
- Performance comparison

The goal is to determine which architecture performs better based on predictive accuracy and error metrics.
